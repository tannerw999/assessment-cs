    Push scales better overall between the functions because even on the extraLargeArray it is still computing the function in ms while the unshift function is now in seconds.
    
    For smaller arrays insert(unshift) is faster because it puts the new value at the start of the array and then moves the rest of the values 1 spot.  It already knows the starting point where it needs to put the value and it's not having to shift many values.  Once we get to the mediumArray append(push) becomes faster to count each index and tack on the new value to the end using push than to tack the new value onto the start using unshift and then move each index value.
